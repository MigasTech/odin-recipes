    <h2>Description of the recipe</h2>
        <p>Cozido is a classic Portuguese stew made with various types and cuts of meat and different vegetables. 
       It appears in numerous frugal and sophisticated variations throughout the country and can also incorporate smoked meat and spicy smoked or blood sausages.
       This comforting winter meal is believed to have originated as a simple farmer’s dish which soon became a restaurant staple and a part of Portuguese national cuisine. Traditionally, the cooked ingredients are served on a platter accompanied by rice and beans, while the flavorful broth is usually enjoyed as an appetizer.
